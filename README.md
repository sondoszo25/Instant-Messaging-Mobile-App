in this homework, we made a communication application where many people can communicate with each other.
the user can add, delete, and chat with other users.

to create an account we should register first and add our info in all the fields that are required except the image 
and the password should contain at least 8 charcters should include upper and lower case character and number at least. 


on the top side of the sign in screen there is a settings button where you can change the server address(our default address is http://10.0.2.2:5000/api/)
you also have the option to change the theme of the app by turning the toggled button on.

to run the server we should run "ourServer" by the instructions in the readme of "ourServer" repo.

we should connect to firebase first, to connect to the firebase we added the email ap2023.biu@gmail.com to the "mtkdem2-targel3-final" project.
